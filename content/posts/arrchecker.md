ARR-Checker is a simple [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mod which checks the license metadata of other mods in your Minecraft
instance to make sure every single one is open-source.

If ARR-Checker finds a mod which is not open-licensed, it will print information about it
to the console.
That's it! It doesn't do anything else.

This might be useful to you if you want to create a mod-pack that only includes open-license
mods.

This mod requires [Fabric API](https://github.com/fabricmc/fabric) which you can download
**[HERE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)**
