**If you are not fully supportive of trans people, or have anything against furries,
then leave this site immediately. You are not welcome here, or on my social media!**

Otherwise, welcome! Feel free to read on!

Hi, I'm Caroline!
I'm a non-binary trans woman who makes Minecraft mods,
professionally tests video games, and (tries) to make them.

My pronouns are She/Her, or They/Their/Them.
But I'd prefer if you'd just *not* refer to me indirectly, where possible.

On this website, you can find some of my personal projects,
which include but are not limited to:
 - Minecraft Mods:
   - [Ex-Features](../ex-features)
   - [ARR-Checker](../arrchecker)
   - [Fabricators' Construct](../fconstruct)
   - [More Creeps and Weirdos](../morecreeps)
   - [Mo' Creatures](../mocreatures)
 - Video Games:
   - [Basuoland](../basuoland)
   - [LiteCraft](../litecraft)

You can also find an [art gallery](../art-gallery) of [my fursona](../fursona),
and links to my Minecraft server (when it's available),
and my [Discord](../../discord.html) server.
