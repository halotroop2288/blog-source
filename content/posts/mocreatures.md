[Mo' Creatures](https://www.mocreatures.org/) is a mod by Dr. Zhark,
which has had its source code released under an open license recently.
I plan to port this mod to Fabric Mod Loader when I'm done with
[More Creeps Refabricated](../morecreeps).

You can download the original mod **[HERE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mo-creatures/download/2628698)**.

You can view the source code for my fork (when it's released) **[HERE](https://github.com/halotroop2288/Mo-Creatures)**.
